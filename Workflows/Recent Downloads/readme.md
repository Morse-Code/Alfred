## Alfred v.2 workflow: "Recent Downloads"

An Alfred workflow for automating actions on the most recently downloaded items in your designated download directory (i.e. “~/Downloads”). The workflow is for use with Alfred v. 2.x and will not work with earlier versions. This is a port of the similarly named Alfred v.1 extension developed by Okke Tijhuis ([@otijhuis](https://twitter.com/@otijhuis), [otijhuis.tumblr.com](http://otijhuis.tumblr.com)), and [David](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com).
**Installation:**

1. Download and unpack the .zip archive.
2. Double-click the “Recent Downloads.alfredworkflow” to install. 

The original authors did a great job of documenting the corresponding Alfred v.1 extension upon which this workflow is primarily composed from. This documentation is included in the repo in the file "Recent Downloads Extension.pdf".
